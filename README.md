# Testing the necessity of complex numbers on Cirq Simulation

This study is about an experiment that proves that quantum theory has complex numbers in Hilbert space. This study contains a simulation of proven work on IBM [1] on Cirq, starting with the first theoretically proven [2] studies. The experiments focused on a study known as Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality [3], which utilizes the sharing of Bell statuses.

### NOTE: It is not an academic study, it is just out of individual curiosity.
